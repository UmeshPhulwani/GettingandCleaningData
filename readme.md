This repository GettingandCleaningData is for submitting Peer assignments of data science course Getting and Cleaning Data.

It has one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

For understanding run_analysis.R please refer CookBook.md

This repository also contains the final outcome of the peer assignment i.t Tidy_dataset.txt
